## R packages we like

### Essential R packages
- [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/): must-have suite of packages for data wrangling and analysis that includes many other packages, e.g.:
  - dplyr for data management
  - tidyr for tidying your data
  - ggplot2 for data visualization
  - stringr for string filtering and manipulation (recommended by [@frog_phylo](https://twitter.com/frog_phylo/status/1265633360153579520?s=20))
