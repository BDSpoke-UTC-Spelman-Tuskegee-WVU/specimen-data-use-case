# specimen-data-use-case

This repository serves as a place to collect specific use cases of biodiversity specimen data, such as records found on the [iDigBio Portal](https://www.idigbio.org/portal/) or on [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/). The goal of this repository is to document use cases conceptually, and link to related repositories (see below) or external resources for technical solutions.
