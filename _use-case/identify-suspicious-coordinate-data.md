title: Identify specimen records with suspicious coordinate data
category: geospatial
---

### Conditions

1. User needs to find records where the original coordinate data has been altered by the data aggregator.
1. User needs to visualize results on a map.
1. User wants to explore additional facets of these records, e.g. what collections within an institution they belong to.

### Example scenario

Institutional data manager would like to identify how well different collections are doing on their georeferencing projects. Data manager wants to understand this from both a record-level and collection-level perspective, and needs to be able to show collection managers the affect that coordinate data quality issues have on a specimen record.
