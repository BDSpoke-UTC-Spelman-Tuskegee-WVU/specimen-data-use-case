title: Search based on data quality flag
category: search
---

### Conditions

1. User is a data provider interested in reviewing and, where appropriate, correcting their data based on the results of an aggregator's data quality tests.
1. Results of the data quality test are stored as "flags" and the user is interested in searching based on a specific flag.

### Example scenario

Collection manager has recently published data to iDigBio and would like to review the flags assigned to their records by the iDigBio data quality checks that were run when the data were ingested. Collection manager is specifically interested in seeing flags related to geographic coordinates, since they don't have a great way to check those within their own internal database.
