### Conditions

### Example scenario

Project manager for a TCN needs to report digitization progress based on data that have been mobilized to iDigBio. Digitization progress is being measured by a count of specimen records, a count and percent of specimen records with associated media records, and a count and percent of specimen records with coordinate data. Data facets should include data provider (i.e. contributing collection/institution) and published date. Report should be able to be generated easily every month.
