title: Overlay geospatial data and specimen data
category: geospatial

### Conditions

1. User has a dataset of specimen records.
1. User has geospatial data in the form of a shapefile.

### Example scenario

Registrar at a natural history museum needs to provide the U.S. Department of the Interior with a list of the museum's specimens collected on National Park Service land. This is difficult to do because different collections within the museum maintain specimen data in different formats, and many of the specimen collecting localities do not mention National Parks by name. Additionally, in some cases park boundaries have been added and/or changed since specimens were collected. Registrar would like to use georeferenced data in iDigBio to help identify specimens for this list that otherwise might be missed.
